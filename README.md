This Project was meant do be the Backend API for a school project webdevelopment 2. While it is still intended to be, i ran into too much problems en workarounds for it to be completed in the timeframe right now.
Functionalities that are working right now:

- Hosted on heroku connected functioning as a  'working' API / Laravel Project - Board-Games-Api (Github) / (board-games-api-school-7a1eeb2c4b6f.herokuapp.com/api/boardgames)
- Connected to a PostGre database from Heroku
- Capable of showing a list of Boardgames said Database.
- Can be reached from the VUE project that is hosted.

The goal is to build another project from scratch in the next period but i might build the API from scratch again because the generated Laravel packages are hard to decipher for now.

For the grader that is reading this:

Incomplete project but submitted anyway to keep a record of my progress.

Personal note: I have learned a lot in this project A lot of errors and problems. The main problem is api.php which is autogenerated doesn't work and web.php wants CRFG token validation while i want to work with JWT. After a lot of stackoverflow, chatgpt, headaches and misery i just ran out of time.

SUNK-COST-FALLACY. (should've gone with Docker and a simpler setup....)

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
